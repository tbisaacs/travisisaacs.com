This work is so old that I'm reluctant to show it to you. I've come a long way since 2004-2006. Despite it's dated (and somewhat questionable) aesthetics, the foundation the RadioTime team and I laid way back then have rocketed RadioTime into an radio data market leader. Today RadioTime serves up over 50 million listening sessions per month. 

Booyah.
