<p>I'll be heading to ol' <a href="http://iub.ed">IU</a> next Thursday to once again speak at <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~telecom/multivisions2007/index.html">MultiVisions</a>.</p>

	<p>I vividly remember the panic that I felt my senior year of college.</p>

	<p>Where will I go?</p>

	<p>Who is hiring?</p>

	<p>Is my portfolio good?</p>

	<p>Do I need to freelance more?</p>

	<p>Somehow talking to the recent grads at MultiVisions made it all feel better. There are so many things the don't (and perhaps couldn't) prepare you for in college for life out in the wild. </p>

	<p>I feel somewhat blessed to have had so many unique and fulfilling experiences in just 5 shorts years after college. I've worked for a <a href="http://readingglasses.com">bustling small business</a>, an <a href="http://www.radiotime.com">intense and challenging startup</a>, a <a href="http://www.travelocity.com">travel industry leader</a>, and now somewhere in between all that, I think I've finally found <a href="http://sabreux.com">my place</a>.</p>

	<p>If sharing my experience reassures and comforts even just one student, the trip was worth it.</p>
