I'm not dead, just enjoying fatherhood. Every day is better than the previous ever since my daughter Audrey (it still feels weird saying that) was born in June. These days I trade my free time for feedings and diaper changes, but I am rewarded with smiles, giggle, and hugs. A fair trade if you ask me.

I have a feeling that she'll be my greatest accomplishment. 

<h2>Rocking at Viewzi</h2>

I'm really happy with the stride we've hit at Viewzi. With our recent additions of <a href="http://www.bigdumbdev.com/">Steve Brewer</a>, <a href="http://chrisjdavis.org">Chris J. Davis</a>, and <a href="http://www.iamseanfields.com/">Sean Fields</a>, we've really cranked up the speed and quality at which we deliver. 

In our most recent release we added view information, favorite views, view ratings, and being able to set a default view. Read more about that <a href="http://corp.viewzi.com/index.php/v2/entry/fall_is_upon_us/">here</a>. 

We've also been <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tbisaacs/2965252872/">re-thinking the details</a> of our view mix experience to better communicate the search-view concept. We're in super-polish mode right now, but expect more details (and a longer post on this) soon.
