<p>I've been <a href="http://www.poetpainter.com/thoughts/article/whats-in-your-bookstack" target="_blank">tagged by Stephen</a>...</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, my "BookStack" is pretty short right now. Between <a href="http://www.localhost:8888/travis/index.php?id=20">preparing</a> <a href="http://www.localhost:8888/travis/index.php?id=16">presentations</a>, freelance work, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tbisaacs/1732769453/" target="_blank">major life events</a>,  my free time doesn't come cheap. </p>

	<p>I usually have a few books in queue. Sometimes I'll tear through a book all at once, but often I'll read a few chapters, put it down, then pick up another and start, and then circle back around. For example, I read the Bringhurst book cover to cover over the course of a week. Now I'm reading again more closely. In contrast, I've been picking at Kite Runner since I went to Seattle a few months ago. </p>

	<p>My wife Kristi pokes at me for reading "manuals" instead of "stories." As you can see, she's on to something!</p>
