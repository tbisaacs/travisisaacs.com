The last 60 days have been a dream. I launched <a href="http://keynotekungfu.com/" target="_blank">Keynote Kung-Fu</a> with hopes of selling a <em>few</em> copies of my toolkit. I fully expected the splash that it made at the Big Design 2010 conference to come and go.

But it didn't. 

I'm humbled by the support from my peers and the recognition from the community's <a href="http://keynotekungfu.com/#quotes" target="_blank">most well known designers</a>. Your influence has made this product a success.


<h2>Version 2.0</h2>

Version 2.0 just hit the servers this morning. It's chock full of iOS, iPad, and iPhone interface elements. All of the new elements are meticulously recreated in "native" Keynote.
