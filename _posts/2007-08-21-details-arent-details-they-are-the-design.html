<p>If you are a designer, you've heard that a million times before. It's so very true. </p>

	<p>Here is an example I snapped today while redeeming a gift certificate:</p>

	<p><img src="http://travisisaacs.com/assets/img/posted/details.gif" alt="Details, or lack there of" /></p>

	<p>The system is telling the user to click here for their receipt (click here and do what?), but then says, "<em>oh, you might want to wait a second, it might not be ready yet, but I have no idea</em>."</p>

	<p>I find it hard to believe that the system doesn't know when it had finished generating the receipt. The reality is the developer carelessly (or <em>thoughtlessly</em> as <a href="http://poetpainter.com" target="_blank">Stephen</a> would say) glossed over this contradictory interaction.</p>

	<p>Here is an idea:</p>

	<p><img src="http://travisisaacs.com/assets/img/posted/creating.gif" alt="Creating receipt" /></p>

	<p>Provide the customer with some status about what's happening. If the system says, "<em>wait, I'm still working on that</em>" we'll wait for it. No questions. </p>

	<p>Next, the system should politely tell the customer when it's finished:</p>

	<p><img src="http://travisisaacs.com/assets/img/posted/done.gif" alt="I'm done" /></p>

	<p>And just to be nice, how about a more descriptive verb. "<em>Click here to view</em>" doesn't tell me much. The end result is to most likely print.</p>
