<p>The ability to craft (and deliver) a good presentation should be in the quiver of every designer, right along side their Moleskine and Micron pens (<a href="http://garrettdimon.com/">Garrett</a> prefers Sharpies and a <a href="http://www.behance.com/Outfitter/Products/Dot-Grid-Book/9">Dot Grid Book</a>). </p>

	<p>I use presentations to unravel a vague idea or requirement to be sure I completely understand all of the facets and details. If I can't clearly explain a topic or idea then I need to go back to the project stakeholder and regroup. In some cases this will uncover holes that need to be address even before I start sketching out a wire frame.  </p>

	<p>I'll be presenting <strong>Influencing Change Through Presentations</strong> at <a href="http://designthinkingexec.backpackit.com/pub/1239101">Design Thinking Dallas</a> on Friday October 19th. Officially:</p>

<blockquote>   
Have you ever sat through a bad presentation? Me too! In this session weâ€™ll see how a well designed presentation can be an invaluable tool for telling your story, incubating ideas, and making change in your organization.

	<p>Design Thinking will be an all day session about "thinking different" and will feature a keynote from <a href="http://chrisbernard.blogs.com/design_thinking_digest/">Chris Bernard</a> and many other Dallas superstars. This all day event it only $40 dollars if you <a href="http://www.stc-dfw.org/pages/designthinking2007_reserv.htm">register in advance</a>, $50 at the door.</p>
