<small class="caption">(Thanks to John from <a href="http://aptonic.com" target="_blank">Aptonic</a> for sharing his heatmap with us)</small>

It's exquisite, isn't it? His visitors rarely strayed from <strong>download</strong>, <strong>features</strong>, and <strong>purchase</strong>. 

This is simple, executed perfectly. 

<strong>Try it for yourself</strong>
Hike on over to <a href="http://trailheadapp.com">Trailhead</a> and test your own site for just $10.
