Welcome to an experiment.

My compadre <a href="http://twitter.com/stevebrewer">Steve Brewer</a> and I have a long record of designing and building cool things...for other people. So, three weeks ago we said goodnight to our nights and weekends and started building.

<a href="http://trailheadapp.com" target="_blank">Trailhead</a> is a product that we built to help designers, usability testers, and marketers understand how people use their site by gathering mouse movement and click data. It's lightweight, simple, and deliberately barebones. There are other services that do this, but they are expensive and complicated, and in my mind, their subscription models don't reflect the needs of the professionals that use them.

We made it really easy to make your test results accessible to the public. This is great for sharing your results with a team or for bragging rights. Here's a heatmap of my site:

<h3>What's next</h3>
There are still some rough edges in Trailhead, but nothing that would hold us back from launching. We'll iterate quickly, listen to feedback, and probably make a few mistakes.

<h3>Special thanks</h3>
Steve and I would like to extend a sincere thank you to <a href="http://sonspring.com" target="_blank">Mr. Nathan Smith</a> for helping us test Trailhead on his baby, <a href="http://960.gs" target="_blank">960.gs</a>. Thank you Nathan!
