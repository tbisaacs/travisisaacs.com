I'm tired of seeing job descriptions with benefits like:

Nintendo Wii
Ping-pong
Guitar hero
Unlimited sodas

Hey, come work here and have fun instead of being accountable for the success of our business. Believe me, I'm no corporate suit, but this coddling has to stop. 

Instead they should be saying - come join in creating our business, building our brand, and generating revenue. 

Our generation has this sick business mentality of have fun, get traffic, ?????, then profit.
