This past weekend I delivered my presentation, <a href="http://travisisaacs.com/2010/05/10/keynote-kung-fu-coming-to-the-big-design-conference/">Keynote Kung-Fu: How Ninjas Wireframe</a> to a packed house at the Big Design 2010 conference. 

To be honest, I was unsure how this topic with resonate with people. Boy, was I wrong. The response and feedback from the attendees has been so positive.

During the presentation, I summarized the 12 easy lessons that will have you on your way to becoming a Keynote Kung-Fu Master. Here they are in case you missed it.

<h2>Tell as Story</h2>
<p>Not just any story. Tell your audience the story of your interface. Walk them through the experience from a user's perspective. Divide your wireframes up by use case or functional area and dive into each one.</p>

<p>Keynote is so perfect for this because in additional to a powerful wireframe tool, it's presentation capabilities can add a dimension of time. You are no longer limited to a static description of your interface. The story of your interface will be so much more powerful than boring documentation.</p>

<h2>Visually narrate the interface details</h2>

<p>Imagine that your wireframes are a flip-book. Walk your audience through each interaction frame-by-frame.</p>

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/click.jpg" alt="" title="click" width="700" height="160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1083" />

<p>I call out each interaction using annotations like <strong>click</strong>, <strong>pinch</strong>, <strong>swipe</strong>, <strong>tap</strong>, etc. Your audience will clearly see the interaction design details of your wireframe, even if you aren't presenting it first-hand.</p>

<h2>Use master slides for page layouts/types</h2>

<p>This lesson is a game changer, or at least, it was for me. Avoid endless cut-and-paste by putting static elements, like navigation, backgrounds, and site “chrome” in master slides.</p>

<p>Reference the common elements in your slides simply by changing the master slide.</p>

<h2>Create a library of components</h2>

<h2>Copy/Paste style properties to save time</h2>

<h2>Group items whenever possible</h2>

<h2>Learn the keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<h2>Tables are for more than just data</h2>

<h2>Add text to shape layer whenever possible</h2>

<h2>Keep your theme lean</h2>

<h2>Swap between Photoshop/Illustrator with ease</h2>

<h2>Don’t limit yourself to gray boxes</h2>
