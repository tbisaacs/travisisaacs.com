One of my favorite features on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tbisaacs">Flickr</a> is the ability to set privacy options on each photo. This allows me to keep my photos public, but restrict personal family photos to just friends and family:

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-2.png" alt="" title="flickr privacy settings" width="450" height="125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125" />

This gives me a very high level of privacy control both globally and per-photo:

<ul>
<li>Only me</li>
<li>Me, plus friends</li>
<li>Me, plus friends and family</li>
<li>Everyone</li>
</ul>
			
Twitter on the other hand, you only have two options: either all of your tweets are public for the world, or only your friends can see them. If you choose to leave your tweets public, your only option for privacy is to send direct message. Obviously that doesn't scale well.

What if Twitter offered more fine-grained privacy options like Flickr?

This means I could keep my witty banter public for the world to enjoy, or give me the option to complain to just my friends on a per-tweet basis.
