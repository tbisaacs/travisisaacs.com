<p>Ready to unleash your content? On <strong>November 8th</strong> I'll be presenting at <a href="http://refreshdallas.org">Refresh Dallas</a> on <a href="http://www.localhost:8888/travis/index.php?id=16">Microformats</a> and the semantic web. </p>

	<blockquote>The future is bright for the semantic web. One problem- how do we get there? Bridging the gap between todayâ€™s web and the technology of tomorrow is simpler than you might think.

	<p>During this session Travis will discuss adding Microformats to you <span class="caps">XHTML</span> to unlock rich metadata and make your content truly portable.</p>

	<p>Buzz words included: <span class="caps">XFN</span>, hCard, hCalendar, hAtom, <span class="caps">RDF</span>, <span class="caps">POSH</span>, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
	<p>My presentation is a bit different than other presentations on this topic, rather than get into the geeky code bits, I think its more important to focus on the problem that Microformats solve. Talk about the <em>why</em> and less about the <em>how</em>.</p>

	<p>Interested? Join us at Sabre headquarters (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=3150+Sabre+Dr,+Southlake,+TX+76092&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=35.957999,62.753906&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=32.983342,-97.16064&amp;spn=0.009306,0.015321&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">3150 Sabre Drive, Southlake, TX 76092</a>).
