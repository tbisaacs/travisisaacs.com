I've been using <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/">iPhone OS4 </a>on my iPhone for almost 2 weeks. A notable new feature is the ability to create a folder of applications. This feature was meant for guys like <a href="http://jeremyjohnsononline.com">Jeremy Johnson</a>, who has filled up all of the screens on his iPhone.

I love this feature, but I do have a few gripes. 

<h2>Surface Details:</h2> 

Conceptually, a folder is a layer below the spring board. When you click on a folder, the spring board splits horizontally revealing your folder underneath. My problem is that the visual design of the folder surface doesn't look like it's below the spring board layer. The inner shadow isn't strong enough and there is a "bowing" to the surface. Not to mention, that "cheese grater" pattern the Apple invented (almost) is totally the wrong proportion.

<h2>Application Limit:</h2>

You can only put 9 applications into a folder. This is because there only 9 slots (excluding the dock) in the spring board (which gets translated to the preview icon for the folder).

<h2>My Take:</h2>

The changes are subtle, but in my opinion they make a big difference.

<ul>
<li><strong>No limit to applications:</strong> A folder can hold as many apps as you want. There is a badge in the title that tells you how many apps are in the folder. The preview icon simply shows the first nine apps.</li>
<li><strong>Folders can scroll:</strong> Each folder will have a Safari-like scrollbar. It's there when you need it, and dismisses itself when not in use.</li>
<li><strong>Visual clues to show more:</strong> There is vignetting at the bottom of the folder to provide a visual cue that there is more content that's not visible.</li>
<li><strong>Recessed surface:</strong> The visual details for the folder surface look more like a layer that is below the spring board. I made the inner-shadow much more prominent, and the background is flat. I also toned down that background pattern.</li>
</ul>
