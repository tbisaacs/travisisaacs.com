In the article, he specifically points to the restaurant finder applications by "IntelligentMobiles". If you aren't familiar, basically, they are all the same application, but they vary by restaurant. So you have "Burger King Finder", "Pizza Hut Finder", etc.

MG's criticism is two fold - 1) Developers are "flooding" the AppStore with "crap" in attempts to "milk" customers for money and 2) The iPhone offers the same functionality in the native Google Maps application (for free).

I personally don't get the rub here. 

InteligentMobiles understood that finding a restaurant with Google Maps, while straightforward, could be much simpler. Instead of a few clicks, their app does it in one. If you frequently look for a specific restaurant, their app is a much better experience. To some consumers, that convenience is worth $1.99. Don't blame IntelligentMobiles for that. 

MG's point that these apps are a "rip-off"  (and "confusing" to customers) since Google Maps already offers this functionality is flawed. It's like saying the ability to add shortcuts on the home-screen is unnecessary because there is a perfectly good URL bar and search box in Safari.
