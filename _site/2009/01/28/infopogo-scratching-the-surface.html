A few weeks ago I was contracted by the guys at Infopogo.com to give their prototype some design love. If you haven't seen it yet, InfoPogo is a research tool that searches census, demographic, housing, crime, and a whole bunch of other public data (don't let me trivialize it, it's much more than that) by US regions. 

Looking for the median family income for Beverly Hills? <a href="http://www.infopogo.com/City/Demographic/Beverly_Hills_city.CA">It was $102,611 in 1999</a>. Pretty neat huh? 

The InfoPogo guys have big plans for the application, including making improvements on the <a href="http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf">other planes of User Experience</a>, however, any improvements on the surface would go along way. 

The InfoPogo team has spent countless hours in making their components and controls as re-usable as possible, so it was important not to create a bunch of work for them for the sake of design. In order to make it easy for them to implement, much of my HTML/CSS started from the markup that they already had on the site.
<h3>Flexible Crumbs</h3>
The crumbs are built using the <code>last-child</code> CSS selector so that the last <code>li</code> is automatically formatted appropriately.

From the developer's point of view, it's a simple unordered list. (<em>Oh, and I know what you are thinking - Internet Explorer doesn't like <code>last-child</code>. Have you seen <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/">ie7.js</a></em>?) 

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors2/">Doug Bowman's sliding doors</a> method for making tabbed navigation seems like a hundred years old in Internet years, but it is still one of the most flexible and bulletproof methods for creating tabbed navigation from an unordered list.

The flexibility is important because as InfoPogo matures, the names of these tabs might change and there may be more tabs to come. This is one example that requires a bit of extra markup for the developers, but in the end they are still just rendering an unordered list. 

<h3>Summaries</h3>
The summary components don't currently exist on the site, but will soon. Each summary unit is marked up as a definition list and is automatically styled (again, using <code>last-child</code>) and floated into place. The summary's parent container doesn't care how many individual summary "units" are inside, it will handle them appropriately.

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/infopogo-summary.jpg" alt="infopogo-summary" title="infopogo-summary" width="694" height="151" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-545" />

The default summary unit will handle fairly large numbers, but can be extended if the needs arises to accommodate very large numbers.

<h3>Data Grids</h3>
Most of the data is presented in a tabular fashion so it was important to design some flexible <code>table</code> markup. This meant accounting for the baseline table styles, such as <code>td</code>'s and <code>th</code>'s, but also extending the basic styles for additional presentation and functionality. For example, adding the class <code>alt-row</code> to the <code>table</code> tag added alternating rows.

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/infopogo-datatable.jpg" alt="infopogo-datatable" title="infopogo-datatable" width="695" height="204" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-550" />

 A lightweight script looks for tables with this class and adds the needed markup client-side with no additional work from the development team.

<h3>Pulling it Together</h3>
Here is an example (although, not a <em>real</em> page) of all of the newly skinned components working together:

It will be really exciting to watch InfoPogo come together and mature over the next few months, so keep your eye out.
