<p>While I don't generally do more than one <a href="http://travisisaacs.com/work/">freelance</a> project at a time, that doesn't mean that I don't need a little help keeping on top of things. </p>

	<p>I'm working a small freelance site for a sales rep that is due to launch this month. This time around, I believe that I have discovered the holy trinity of project management: <a href="http://blinksale.com">Blinksale</a>, <a href="http://basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, and <a href="http://getharvest.com">Harvest</a>. </p>

	<p>Your mileage may vary, but I believe this solution is perfect. </p>

<h2>Blinksale</h2>

	<p>I signed up for Blinksale the day it launched because I'm a <a href="http://firewheeldesign.com/">firewheel</a> fanboy and Josh is a local. </p>

	<p>Prior to Blinksale I was using PayPal for everything. While it does ok for invoicing, I got tired of them taking my money. Even though I can still use PayPal with blinksale, I reverted to back to accepting old fashioned checks. </p>

	<p>Blinksale is dead simple, not to mention sexy. My only wishlist is that they add auto-increment invoice numbers. I hate making up a number every time.</p>

<h2>Basecamp</h2>

	<p>Wow, how did I manage before Basecamp?</p>

	<p>Basecamp is not a replacement for real interaction with your client, nor is it a crutch for having a poor project scope. </p>

	<p>However, it is a marvelous tool for clearly keeping your clients informed of the project's status and what is expected from them. It allows me to do collaborative design with my client. We work together on page copy using writeboards, they review my mockups using messages, and we all get things done with milestones and task.</p>

<h2>Harvest</h2>

	<p><a href="http://harvest.com">Harvest</a> was the missing link. I had the invoicing and the project management, but I was still recording my time with excel spreadsheets. </p>

	<p>The harvest widget is the icing on the cake. It only takes a click to stop and start recording and switch tasks. </p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

	<p>Basecamp really the hub of the entire workflow. Both Blinksale and Harvest support the Basecamp <span class="caps">API</span> making it easy to import projects.</p>
