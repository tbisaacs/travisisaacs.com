I suppose it's the end of an era. 

Last month I made the difficult decision to leave my position as lead (and only) designer at <a href="http://www.radiotime.com" target="_blank">RadioTime</a>. Despite the building momentum at <acronym title="Consumer Electronics Show">CES</acronym> and opportunities to work with companies like Cisco and Hillcrest Labs, I just was not happy any more. 

I wanted something different, I wanted a shorter commute, and I wanted to work with other designers and IA's I could learn from.

After only one meeting over fajitas at Blue Mesa Grill with Stephen and Jeremy, I knew that the User Experience team at Sabre would be my new home. I joined the team 4 weeks ago as an interaction designer.

Why?

<ul>
<li>It's 5 miles from my house. No more one hour commutes up dangerous and dirty highway 635.</li>
<li>I'll be able to grow as an interaction designer and have <a href="http://jeremyjohnsononline.com" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://poetpainter.com" target="_blank">rockstars</a> for mentors. I'll be forced out of my comfort zone and grow in areas that I previously hadn't been exposed to.</li>
<li>I'll be improving an impressive portfolio of projects used by most every travel agent and major airport world wide</li>
</ul>

It's an incredible opportunity that I couldn't pass up.
