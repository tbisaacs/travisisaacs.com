<p>At this year's <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com">Jason</a> and <a href="http://robweychert.com">Rob</a> led a <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;#38;id=IAP060112">great panel</a> on finding and maintaining inspiration in everyday life. </p>

	<p>Citing <a href="http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/_work/design_vigilante/">Kevin Cornell</a>, they suggested becoming a <strong>design vigilante</strong>. "If you love design, take it back!"</p>

	<p>This idea really resonated with me. I've always believed that design should be used for good in everyday life. And the best way to stay inspired and keep learning is practice. Find a design problem and solve it. </p>

	<p>I've got a few blog posts in the queue of some quick before &amp; after websites that I made over for the sheer fun of it. After realizing the power of this exercise, I ran home and bought <strong>designvigilante.com</strong>! </p>

	<p>I must admit, I'm very shocked this was available. Look for something soon.</p>
