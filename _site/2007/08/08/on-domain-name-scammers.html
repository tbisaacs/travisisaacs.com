	<p>I'm trying to sell "mylifeinpixels.com" to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=canon+5d&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">raise some extra cash</a>. I've owned it for about five years, but haven't actively used it for the last two. </p>

	<p>My friend Steve commented on how cool the domain was. That sparked my curiosity so I ran it through a few free an paid appraisal services. The results were mixed between $1,000 and $2,100. The biggest negative is that it's a lot to type.</p>

	<p>I started out listing on eBay but pulled it after 6 days of almost no activity. After some research I came across <a href="http://afternic.com">Afternic</a> and decided to list. Feedback about Afternic around the web was mixed. Unfortunately domain name sale is a shady business, second only to porn and boner pills. Regardless, I decided to list for a cheap $1,000.</p>

	<p>They next day I recieved a email from "Driscoll":</p>

	<p><blockquote><br />

</blockquote></p>

	<p>I was really excited. Being a n00b, I asked Driscoll to make me an offer:</p>

<blockquote>
Thanks for contacting me. I am still interested in selling mylifeinpixels.com. 
It has appraised between $1,000 and $2,1000 dollars (varies between appraisal 
services). I'd sell it for something in between those two figures.
</blockquote>

	<p>Driscoll:</p>

<blockquote>
I heard many appraisal companies often made inaccurate appraisals. So I
cannot accept appraisal from each and every site. I will only accept
appraisals from independent appraisal companies I know and trust.
</blockquote>

	<p>Fair enough. When buying a used car you should always kick the tires and take it to a mechanic. </p>

<blockquote>
I have an appraisal from afternic and one from leapfish. You contacted 
me through afternic, 
so I assume you trust them.
</blockquote>

	<p>Here is where it gets interesting:<br />
<blockquote><br />
I thought about several companies including Afternic.com, but found very<br />
interesting information:</p>

	<p>http://www.igoldrush.com/links3.htm<br />
Capsule Review: After lots of complaints, Afternic is no longer a<br />
recommended service. We will re-review the service in the near future.</p>

	<p>I also found the following information about them<br />
http://www.out-law.com/page-1630</p>

	<p>So Afternic.com is <span class="caps">NOT</span> acceptable.</p>

	<p>Reading responses from experienced sellers I was impressed by one reply:<br />
"Many Internet users are not smart enough and popular domain brokers are<br />
using this fact to make money. They offer them cheap appraisal services. <br />
But if their customers would have something in their heads they'd understand<br />
experts could not make a professional research for $15-$20. These appraisals<br />
are made by machines. Easy money for such appraisers as<br />
http://www.Afternic.com and several other major brokers that offer cheap<br />
auto-generated appraisals. In my eyes, all services under $50-$55 are not<br />
manual and the results are generated by special scripts. I don't trust<br />
auto-generated appraisals."</p>

	<p>The same is true for GoDaddy and <span class="caps">SEDO</span>. Their services are not manual. <br />
They are just collecting money using their well-known names.</p>

	<p>I heard many appraisal companies often overpriced domains. So I cannot <br />
accept appraisal from each and every site.</p>

	<p>To avoid mistakes I asked about reputable appraisers in a forum. Several <br />
experts recommended me DomainSecondHands' appraisal service, http://www.domainsecondhand.com/appraisal.htm as a fast, accurate and <br />
non-expensive manual service.<br />
</blockquote></p>

	<p>Oh snap! </p>

	<p>One look at domainsecondhand.com and I knew I was being scammed. Would you give them your credit card. Curious, I googled Mark Driscoll and BN technologies but found nothing. That would be too easy. </p>

	<p>Looking at the email header:</p>

	<p><code>Received: from diamondoji4lze (ppp128-18.dialup.mtu-net.ru [62.118.128.18])</code></p>

	<p>What <span class="caps">CEO</span> is using a dial-up account from Russia? Interesting&amp;#8230;. A lucky search for "diamondoji4lze" turned up lots of hits, coincidentally threads all about people being scammed over domain sales. In fact, the first two results yielded a copy of nearly the same email I had received from Driscoll</p>

	<p>From user "metals" on <a href="http://www.sedo.com/forum/index.php4?task=showthread&amp;thread=2772&amp;tmp=&amp;tracked=&amp;partnerid=&amp;language=e" target="_blank">Sedo.com</a>:</p>

	<p>Busted! Just for good measure, <a href="http://www.namepros.com/179789-domain-name-appr" target="_blank">here is the same email on Namepros.com</a>.</p>

	<p>Needless to say I haven't heard from Driscoll. I assume he's moved on to an easier mark.</p>

	<p><b>Updated September 10th</b></p>

	<p>While reviewing my referral logs today, I noticed that since this posting, my story now comes up as the third result in google for "domainsecondhand" and "domainsecondhand scam."</p>

	<p><img src="http://travisisaacs.com/assets/img/posted/domainsecondhand.jpg" alt="domain second hand google screenshot" /></p>

	<p>Awesome. </p>

	<p>After more digging, the emails are alleged to originate from domainsecondhand.com themselves. The scam is to get people to get their domain appraised there, then the "buyer" mysteriously vanishes.</p>
