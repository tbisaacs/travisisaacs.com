It's no secret that I'm a sucker for clear, concise information design. My passion for this discipline is a perfect fit at <a href="http://viewzi.com">Viewzi</a> because I get to re-imagine the presentation of data (specifically, search-related data) on a daily basis for a wide range of subjects. Please join <a href="http://poetpainter.com">Stephen P. Anderson</a> and I as we cover the basics of effective information design as well as dive into more complex examples. 

Officially: 

<blockquote>We all work with information. In our web sites. Our web apps. Print communications. Graphs, and charts. But how exactly do you present information in a way that simplifies the complex, communicates powerfully, and actually delights people?

Join us, as Travis Isaacs and <a href="http://poetpainter.com">Stephen P. Anderson</a> share their information design secrets. From travel plans to search results to quarterly earnings statements—they’ll present a handful of information design and data visualization case studies, identifying those principles we can apply to just about any project.

Learn how to identify and group related information, create a visual hierarchy, draw focus to the most important content, use images appropriately, see familiar data in a fresh new way, and much more!</blockquote>
