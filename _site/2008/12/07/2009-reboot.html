Howdy, and welcome to 2009 (almost).

<h3>Now I'm packing</h3>

A portfolio that is. I haven't had a portfolio on the web since 2005-ish. Why? Because they are so hard to maintain. However, with my new found love of Wordpresss the task is suddenly a lot less painful. Inside you'll find representative samples of my work and projects. 

<h3>Under the hood</h3>
<strong>Wordpress 2.7</strong> - so far 2.7 has been really impressive. Admittedly I'm not taking advantage of any of the new features yet, but I am going to dig in soon. 

<strong>960.gs</strong> - I've started this new theme from scratch with <a href="http://960.gs">960.gs</a>. I used Blueprint on the last version of the site without any major problems, but I generally prefer the lighter syntax of 960.

<h3>Still a lot to do</h3>

I still have a lot of minor cleanup to do - mostly around merging elements from the old theme into the new one. I also don't have pagination on any categories yet.

<strong>Updated:</strong> Also, apparently Opera 9 pukes on my nav up top. Sorry Opera users, I'll fix soon.

Thanks for stopping by, and please leave and feedback below!
