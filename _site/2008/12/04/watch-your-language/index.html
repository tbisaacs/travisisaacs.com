Last night I ordered some family Christmas cards from an unnamed photography products company that starts with a K. Making the card was very easy - you simply upload a photo and edit the pre-defined areas of the card for a personal touch.

At the end of the process you specify how many cards you want to order:

Without thinking, I entered 60 because we wanted 60 cards. Prepare for sticker shock - <strong>$419.40</strong>. Upon closer inspection, each 'unit' is a set of 10 cards:

But the order form clearly asks how many <strong>cards</strong> you want, not how many <strong>sets</strong>:

This could be fixed in a number of easy ways, starting with simply using consistent language. If the unit is 'sets', then that is a good place to start. 

A better way would be to display the number of total cards you get with each set you add:

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/order-card-sets-after.jpg" alt="" title="order-card-sets-after" width="500" height="146" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159" />

This would be much less error prone because you can see the total number of cards. If I entered 60 sets and saw that I got 600 cards, I would quickly understand the problem. In addition, the form could alert you if a certain threshold is reached, for example, "are you sure you want 600 cards?"
