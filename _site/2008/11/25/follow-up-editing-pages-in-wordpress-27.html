<a href="http://travisisaacs.com/2008/11/13/managing-pages-in-wordpress-a-wish-list/">Last week I noted that editing pages</a> - specifically changing a page's sort order, parent, and template - are particularly cumbersome in the current 2.6x release. I suggested the simple alternative would be to simply expose these common functions on the page manager itself, as well as offer drag-and-drop page re-order to set the page sort order. 

At Wade's suggestion I went and downloaded the 2.7 preview hoping that it was what I was looking for. 

In the page manager you know have a quick edit link next to every page:

<img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/quick-edit.jpg" alt="" title="quick-edit" width="450" height="124" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" />

The quick edit exposes some common page fields - including sort, parent, and template:

<p><a href="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/quick-edit-full.jpg"><img src="http://travisisaacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/quick-edit-full-300x105.jpg" alt="" title="quick-edit-full" width="300" height="105" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-145" /></a>

From a pure clicks standpoint, this isn't much of an improvement. The process is the same amount of steps as the old interface: 

<ul>
<li>Open the quick edit</li>
<li>Make changes</li>
<li>Save</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat for each page</li>
</ul>

If you could trim the first step of having to open each page you could quickly tab through a long list of pages and make changes quickly. Oh, and ditching the save would be nice (have one save button).
