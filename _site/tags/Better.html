            	<p>My fellow flabby, desk-bound geeks—this is for you. Last September I weighed 198 pounds, had a BMI of 30 (obese), 25+% body fat, pre-hypertension, digestion problems, acne, and borderline high cholesterol. Chasing after my two girls was followed by a half-hour recovery period and a shower. Then: Puffy and docile—Now:...</p>

            	<p>I've been using iPhone OS4 on my iPhone for almost 2 weeks. A notable new feature is the ability to create a folder of applications. This feature was meant for guys like Jeremy Johnson, who has filled up all of the screens on his iPhone. I love this feature, but...</p>

            	<p>Last week I noted that editing pages - specifically changing a page's sort order, parent, and template - are particularly cumbersome in the current 2.6x release.
